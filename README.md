## Introductions: Hello There!
<!-- This project was my first attempt at an independent coding project. Started in early 2020, it didn't really go far,  
as I didn't have the skills yet or the passion yet to fully put the effort into this project. Now in the year 2022,  
I feel I do have both the skill and passion to finish this project! -->

To play, first download this repository onto your local computer.
### To play with an IDE like Intellij:

### To play on the command line:
Run this command on the same directory as the project is saved:
[To be added soon!] 

Note: Playing with a Numpad is the ideal way to play!

### How to Play!
You will have to first choose your player piece of choice. At this point you will be instructed to move your piece  
when your turn comes up. The gameBoard is a 3x3 grid. For simplicity and playability each coordinate is labelled a  
number from 1-9. Example below:  
>   123  
>   456  
>   789  

So each number in the Game Board identifies a specific sequence:
>   1 = top left  
>   2 = centre top  
>   3 = top right  
>   4 = centre left  
>   5 = centre  
>   6 = centre right  
>   7 = bottom left  
>   8 = centre bottom  
>   9 = bottom right  

Make sure to read everything too!
